# Marketing Analytics

I am doing a full project, determining why company X is not reaping its marketing effort and also why there is significant drop in customer engagement.

I am going to use several tools to fully achieve the goal for this project.

This includes; 
        1. mssql (considering the data is a backed up file from mssql)
        2. Python ( to do natural text analysis on the review texts)
        3. PowerBi (to best show case my findings)
